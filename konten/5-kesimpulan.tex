\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The results of the research indicate that the following conclusions can be drawn:

For the best-trained model for each architecture, accuracy has decreased in all models. However, accuracy in the PDR class has increased, with the exception of ResNet-50, which has neither increased nor decreased. PDR accuracy on ResNet-152 experienced the most significant increase, amounting to 0.428572. In the Quadratic Weighted Kappa metric, only ResNet 18 and 101 exhibited a decline in value.

In the most validated models for each architecture, accuracy in general decreased in all models, whereas accuracy in the PDR class increased, with the exception of ResNet-18, where no increase or decrease was observed. PDR accuracy on ResNet-152 exhibited the most pronounced increase, reaching 0.357143. In the QWK metric, only ResNet 50 and 101 demonstrated an increase in value.

In the last trained models for each architecture, model accuracy generally decreased, with the exception of ResNet-18 and ResNet-50. In addition, as with the models presented in the preceding tables, the accuracy in the PDR class has increased. ResNet-50 has experienced the most significant increase, with a value of 0.285715. With regard to the QWK metric, only ResNet-101 and ResNet-152 have exhibited an increase in value.
